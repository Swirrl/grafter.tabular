# grafter.tabular

This library contains the deprecated tabular processing from grafter < 0.8.x.

In grafter 0.9.0 functions inside the `grafter.tabular` namespace have
been deprecated and moved into this separate project for easier
evolution of grafter.rdf.

These functions are still maintained, though it is not recommended you
start new greenfield projects with them.
